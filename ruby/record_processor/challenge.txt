Write a Ruby program to first assemble a single set of records by parsing data from 3 different file formats and then display these records sorted in 3 different ways.

GUIDELINES
We hope that this exercise will allow us to evaluate your skills as a developer. The qualities that we pay special attention to are:

        • Simplicity/elegance of design
        • Adherence to good software engineering principles
        • Maintainability (clean, easy to understand code)
        • Effective use of the standard library
        • Use of unit tests
INPUT DATA
A record consists of the following 5 fields: last name, first name, gender, date of birth and favorite color. You will be given 3 files, each containing records stored in a different format.

        • The pipe-delimited file (attached) lists each record as follows:
LastName | FirstName | MiddleInitial | Gender | FavoriteColor | DateOfBirth
        • The comma-delimited file (attached) looks like this:
LastName, FirstName, Gender, FavoriteColor, DateOfBirth
        • The space-delimited file (attached) looks like this:
LastName FirstName MiddleInitial Gender DateOfBirth FavoriteColor

You may assume that the delimiters (commas, pipes and spaces) do not appear anywhere in the data values themselves. Write a Ruby program to read in records from these files and combine them into a single set of records.

DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS
        • Create and display 3 different views of the recordset (see sample attached):
                • Output 1 – sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending.
                • Output 2 – sorted by birth date, ascending.
                • Output 3 – sorted by last name, descending.
        • Ensure that fields are displayed in the following order: last name, first name, gender, date of birth, favorite color.
        • Display dates in the format M/D/YYYY.
