This is a simple program. We have 3 classes in lib, which handles storing the records, processing files, and sorting the list.


To get started you need:

1. Ruby 2.0.0 or greater as defined in the .ruby-version file

2. No unit tests were written. The output seemed suffient enought to run and visually check

3. To run, execute the run.sh file from the command line
